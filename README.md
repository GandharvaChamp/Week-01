# Week-01

Problem Statement: 
Monitoring land use and environmental changes is vital for sustainable development, but traditional land cover mapping methods are slow, manual, and unsuitable for large-scale analysis. This project aims to develop an automated land cover classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify land types such as forest, water, urban areas, and farmland from satellite imagery. The system will support efficient environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management, aligning with global sustainability goals like Climate Action (SDG 13) and Life on Land (SDG 15).

Dataset:
EuroSAT dataset 
Source: Kaggle.

About Dataset:
The EuroSAT dataset is an open-source benchmark dataset based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery collected by the European Space Agency (ESA). It consists of approximately 27,000 labeled images, each covering a 64×64 pixel area, and is categorized into 10 land cover classes including:
1. Industrial
2. Residential
3. River
4. Sea/Lake
5. Forest
6. Pasture
7. Herbaceous Vegetation
8. Annual Crop
9. Permanent Crop
10. Highway
Each image includes 13 spectral bands that capture detailed surface information, making it highly suitable for land cover classification, environmental monitoring, and sustainable land-use analysis. The dataset enables the development of deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automatically classify and analyze Earth’s surface for environmental and sustainability applications.
